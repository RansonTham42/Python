# These fun and interesting Python codes are not meant to be used in unethical and harmful ways. But, you still could. Your choice.
# These codes are purely just for educational purposes, not for killing. Peace.
# Ways of using these codes and consequences of using these codes are outside of my responsibility. Not telling you not to use them. Just be careful.
# If you found a hiccup in one of the codes, stay calm and do not freak out. Because I wrote them.
# Feel free to email me if you have any doubts about the codes or you want to use them for other purposes. I know you probably won't. But try.
# The reason I said the line above this is because I desperately need a friend. Just kidding.
# I have just run out of things to say.
# Do I go now? I'm bored.
# Thanks for reading. I am a beginner by the way.
# If you actually read it, please email me. I want to see how small the world is. Or how big.
# I would probably even reply to your email, if I even receive any in the first place.
# Do you know my email?
# Fine, I will just give you my email right now. Don't spam.
