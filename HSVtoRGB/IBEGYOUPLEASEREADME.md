# Hello, welcome to my code.
# You are lucky you found this code.
# According to MY research, this is one of the first or if not the first HSV to RGB converter done using Python.
# You could either see what I did in that code and try to make it yours (not telling you to republish this code and use it in another website),
# Or just use it.
# This code is extremely easy to understand. I only used the simplest functions e.g. def, int() to write this code as I am a beginner.
# The code is extremely polished and easy-to-use.
# Useful website I used to study about colors and color wheels.
